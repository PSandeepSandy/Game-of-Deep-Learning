# Game-of-Deep-Learning
Ship Classification using Image Processing

This is a multi-class classification problem with 5 types of ships.

It was a 2-week nation-wide competition

## Approach
-	Applied SOTA practices like Transfer Learning, OpenCV, MixUp etc. on an image classification problem with 5 classes.
-	Used architectures like ResNets, NASNets, DenseNets etc 
- Used heavy Data Augmentations like Cutout, Colour Dimension shifts etc.
- Generated an ensemble of all the best performing models

### Rank - 25th out of 2000 (Top 3.4 %).
